<P>There are many benefits for classroom instruction when cooperative learning strategies are done correctly. There are several briefly discussed here including: promotion of social interaction, buildup of student self-confidence, improvement in collaborative skills of students, as well as the improvement in student decision-making skills. Cooperative learning-run classrooms can also assist teachers in working with students who have wider skill gaps.</p>

<p>Teachers with students who work in cooperative learning groups typically allow for more social interaction and can enhance students’ collaborative skills. Cooperative learning groups force students to interact socially and practice collaboration. Teacher lessons that include positive, active student collaboration are planned out with clear directions and expectations for students.</p>

<p>Many students are timid or shy and in a whole-group setting can often be leery of sharing their thoughts, questions, or answers. Students who participate in cooperative learning lessons have opportunities to build their self-confidence (again if planned efficiently and effectively by the teacher). Because of this, teachers have to work really hard to make sure that all students working in cooperative groups have a part in the task. They have to reassure them and hold them accountable. Does every student in the group have a role or responsibility? Is the teacher roaming the classroom during the lesson, asking key questions to check for student understanding and to make sure that they are hearing and seeing all students participate?</p>

<p>Cooperative learning lessons that are planned out efficiently can allow for growth in student decision-making. Students who work in groups and collaborate (talk, plan etc.) are more likely to build on their decision-making skills. Many modern workplaces call for employees who are capable of making decisions while working with “teams” vs. working in isolation. Group lessons that allow for students to collaborate and talk about the task can prompt students to share thoughts and thus build on decision-making skills. A quad, or student group of four, can allow for four different students, with four different thoughts, to build on decision-making skills while improving their socialization. Young people need the socialization, and cooperative learning lessons greatly enhance this.
